## Introduction

Welcome to Vynth, an extensible framework for simulating modular synthesizers in C#.
Designed with versatility in mind, Vynth enables the creation of virtually any audio effect.

**Key Features and Benefits:**

- **Extensibility**: Vynth's architecture allows for creativity, enabling users to craft a wide array of audio effects and functionalities.

- **Ease of Use**: With a focus on user-friendly design, Vynth simplifies the complexities of audio processing, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.

Vynth is a personal project, born from a passion for sound synthesis and software development.

## Project Structure

Vynth is organized into three principal directories, each serving a unique purpose in the framework's ecosystem:

- [src](./src): This directory houses the core of the Vynth framework.

- [demo](./demo): A demonstration project showing a simple synthesizer application, complete with a Unity-based graphical user interface (GUI).
This demo can be used as a reference on how to integrate Vynth into your project.

- [tests](./tests): Test projects, ensuring Vynth works as expected.

For further details on the contents and functionalities within each directory, please refer to the README.md files located in each folder.
